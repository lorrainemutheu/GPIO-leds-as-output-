# GPIO-leds-as-output-
Use of GPIO with LEDS as outputs in AVR microcontrollers

## Introduction
The program is written to demonstrate the working of GPIO with LEDS as outputs in AVR microcontrollers. This is part of a learning series of AVR microcontrollers using Atmega328p.
The LEDS run continuously once the program is uploaded. This setup is mostly used in light decorations or billboard adverts.

## Technologies
#### Software
* Arduino IDE
* C language

#### Hardware
* Atmega328pu microcontroller
* USB to Serial converter (used PL2303 USB to UART converter)
* 16 MHZ crystal
* 22pf capacitors (2)
* 220ohm resistors (6)
* LEDS (6)
* 10kohm resistor (for reset button)
* button (for reset)

## Setup
When using Arduino IDE with Atmega328pu microcontroller ensure that under Tools menu the following are selected before uploading:
* Board: "Arduino Nano"
* Processor: "ATmega328P(Old Bootloader)"
* Port: (choose appropriate port in which USB to Serial Converter is connected)
